## Prep

1. Download and install Xcode 11 Beta 7 from [Beta Software Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/)
2. You don't need to install Catalina, the new Metal powered Simulator is fast enough for fast testing.

## Catalina Install on External SSD

I am running Catalina Beta 10.5 beta 7 on an external SSD with my MacBook Pro 2018 (Samsung T5 500GB ~$100). 

Formatting it was a bit tricky — my Rough notes are to:

1. Open Disk Utility 
1. Show all devices 
2. GUID Partition
3. AFS Format

After install you should be able to hold `Option` on boot to choose the startup disk. Just shutdown completely before removing your SSD drive. 

Updates: Once you install, it's easy to update to the latest beta by using the normal Software Update from System Preferences.
